## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r load}
# The compressed zip archive
  zip_filename <- "activity.zip"

  # The data file stored inside the compressed zip archive
  data_filename <- "activity.csv"

  # Reading the data
  unzip(zip_filename)
  obs <- read.csv(data_filename)

  # Aggregate by day
  steps_per_day <- aggregate(obs$steps, list(steps = obs$steps), sum)
  mean_steps_per_day <- mean(steps_per_day$steps)
  median_steps_per_day <- median(steps_per_day$steps)

  # Aggregate by time
  obs$time_of_day <- 

  # Summarize the data
  summary(obs)
```
Observations: `r dim(obs)[1]`  
Directory: `r getwd()`


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r mean}
hist(steps_per_day$steps, main="Total Steps per day", 
     xlab=paste("Steps
      ", "mean","=",format(mean_steps_per_day,digits=0), 
      "median","=",median_steps_per_day))
abline(v=mean_steps_per_day, lty = 2, lwd = .1, col = "red")
abline(v=median_steps_per_day, lty = 1, lwd = .1, col = "blue")
legend("topright", c(paste("mean","=",format(mean_steps_per_day,digits=0)), 
                     paste("median","=",median_steps_per_day)), 
       col = c("red", "blue"), lty = c(2, 1),
       text.col=c("red", "blue"), bg = "gray90")
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r mean}

```


## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
